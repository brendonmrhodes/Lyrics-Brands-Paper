Your Repository
================

## Repository Organization

Each of your repositories will have a similar organization. There are
certain limitations on the size and type of files that can be pushed to
GitHub. There are also certain things that shouldnâ€™t be accessible by
the public (e.g., data we have a license to access). For these reasons,
we have folders and files that are pushed to GitHub and those that are
not.

### Pushed to GitHub

- `.gitignore` This hidden file specifies what Git should ignore when
  pushing to GitHub. To add a file, include it in `.gitignore` by
  specifying the folder and file name, like so: `Folder/File.extension`.
- `/Assignments` Each assignment must be included in this folder as a
  Quarto file (e.g., `Assignment-02.qmd`) rendered with `format: gfm`
  (i.e., with GitHub-flavored markdown) to produce a Markdown file
  (e.g., `Assignment-02.md`).
- `/Data` While all data not included in the {rethinking} package should
  live here, only data that are small and can be shared publicly should
  be pushed.
- `/Figures` Figures should live here, including images (saved as `.png`
  files), for use in the `README`, presentations, and the `PROJECT`.
- `/Notes` Keep your own notes as you work through *Statistical
  Rethinking* here. It is recommended to do so as an organized series of
  Quarto files (e.g., `Week-03-Notes.qmd`) rendered with `format: gfm`
  to produce a Markdown file (e.g., `Week-03-Notes.md`).
- `/Presentations` Presentations should be live here, preferably as a
  set of Quarto files (e.g., `Interim-Presentation.qmd`) rendered with
  `format: revealjs` to produce an HTML presentation file (e.g.,
  `Interim-Presentation.html`).
- `PROJECT` All project must be included here as a running log of
  clearly labeled milestones and rendered with `format: gfm` to produce
  a markdown file (i.e., `PROJECT.md`).
- `README` This page, with any other organization details to make it
  easy to navigate your repository.

### Not Pushed to GitHub

- `/Output` Output from model runs. These files tend to be too large.
  They are also something each user can create on their own.
- `/Private` PDFs that you want to keep track of reading locally and
  other files you want to keep with your repository.
